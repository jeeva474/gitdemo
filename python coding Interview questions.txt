1. removing duplicates from list
2. finding second largest numbers from the list
	a = [10, 20, 4, 45, 99]

# Initialize largest (max1)
# and second largest (max2) to negative infinity
max1 = max2 = float('-inf')

# Loop through each number in list
for n in a:
  
    # If the current number is greater 
    # than largest found so far
    if n > max1:
      
        # Update second largest to the previous largest
        max2 = max1  
        
        # Update largest to the current number
        max1 = n     
        
    # If current number is less than largest
    # but greater than second largest
    elif n > max2 and n != max1:
      
        # Update second largest to current number
        max2 = n  

print(max2)

3. "[]{}","[}]"

open_list = ["[","{","("]
close_list = ["]","}",")"]
 
# Function to check parentheses
def check(myStr):
    stack = []
    for i in myStr:
        if i in open_list:
            stack.append(i)
        elif i in close_list:
            pos = close_list.index(i)
            if ((len(stack) > 0) and
                (open_list[pos] == stack[len(stack)-1])):
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return "Unbalanced"
    if len(stack) == 0:
        return "Balanced"
    else:
        return "Unbalanced"
